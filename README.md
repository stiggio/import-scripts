# Zuora Catalog Import Script

Imports product catalog data from **Zuora** into **Stigg** by converting Zuora products, rate plans, and charges into Stigg products, plans, add-ons, and prices via the Stigg GraphQL API.

---

## Features

- Imports Zuora products, plans, add-ons, and flat-rate prices into Stigg
- Automatically detects add-ons (`add-on` / `addon` in name)
- Supports **create**, **update**, and **publish** workflows
- **Grandfathered plan forking** — mark plans/add-ons as grandfathered, and the next import creates a new copy with entitlements preserved
- Dry-run mode to preview changes without modifying Stigg

---

## How It Works

- The **first Zuora product** becomes the main product in Stigg
- All plans and add-ons from additional products are assigned to it
- Rate plans are split into **plans** and **add-ons**
- **Flat-rate** and **per-unit** (imported as flat-fee) pricing is supported
- Packages are grouped by Billing Period and created as **draft** by default

---

## Unarchiving Existing Products and Plans

If a product or packages with the same `refId` already exists in the Stigg database and is archived, it will be automatically unarchived during import.

---

## Requirements

- Node.js
- Yarn or NPM

---

## Setup

Use the provided `.env.example` file as a template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update the values in `.env`:

```bash
X_API_KEY=your-stigg-api-server-key
ENVIRONMENT_ID=your-stigg-environment-id
ZUORA_PRODUCT_IDS=zuoraProductId1,zuoraProductId2
```

---

## Install

```bash
yarn install
```

---

## Usage

### Default import

```bash
yarn run zuora-import
```

- Creates **new entities only**
- All entities are created as **draft**

---

### Update mode

```bash
yarn run zuora-import --update
```

- Creates **new entities** if they don’t exist
- Updates **existing entities**
- Does **not** publish

---

### Delete Existing mode (NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION)

```bash
yarn run zuora-import --delete-existing
```

- Deletes existing product before import by ref Id
- Creates **new entities** if they don’t exist
- Does **not** publish

---

### Publish mode

```bash
yarn run zuora-import --publish
```

- Creates **new entities** if they don’t exist
- Publishes **all unpublished entities**
- Does **not** update existing published entities

---

### Update + Publish

```bash
yarn run zuora-import --update --publish
```

- Creates **new entities**
- Updates **existing entities**
- Publishes **all unpublished entities**

---

### Dry-run mode (combinable with any flags)

```bash
yarn run zuora-import --dry-run
yarn run zuora-import --update --dry-run
yarn run zuora-import --publish --dry-run
yarn run zuora-import --update --publish --dry-run
```

- **No changes are applied to Stigg**
- All actions are **previewed in the console only**

---

## Grandfathered Plan Forking

Allows you to "freeze" a plan or add-on in Stigg so it is preserved as-is, while the next import creates a new copy with the latest Zuora data and entitlements carried over.

### Step 1: Fork (mark as grandfathered)

```bash
yarn run zuora-import:fork <plan-or-addon-refId>
```

- Looks up the plan/add-on by `refId` in Stigg
- Sets `GRANDFATHERED: true` in its metadata
- Handles draft/publish lifecycle automatically

### Step 2: Re-run import

```bash
yarn run zuora-import --publish
```

On the next import, the script detects the grandfathered entity and:

1. Creates a **new** plan/add-on with a `-copy-1` suffix (e.g. `Pro_Plan-copy-1`)
2. Copies all **entitlements** from the grandfathered version to the new one
3. Leaves the grandfathered entity untouched

### Chaining

You can fork the copy and re-import again — suffixes increment automatically:

- `Pro_Plan` (grandfathered) → `Pro_Plan-copy-1`
- `Pro_Plan-copy-1` (grandfathered) → `Pro_Plan-copy-2`
- `Pro_Plan-copy-2` (not grandfathered) → updated in place
